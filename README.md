# 🏡 Nashville Housing Analytics  

A complete **data cleaning + visualization project** using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for transformation and **Tableau** for interactive dashboards.  
The goal is to transform raw Nashville housing data into **clean, structured insights** for real estate analysis.  

## 🔧 Data Transformation (SQL)  
Data cleaning was performed in SQL Server Management Studio with the following operations:  
- 🔹 Handling and updating `NULL` values  
- 🔹 Splitting complex fields into atomic columns  
- 🔹 Removing duplicate records  
- 🔹 Standardizing inconsistent date formats  
- 🔹 Ensuring consistency across categorical values  

## 📊 Visualizations (Tableau)  
The cleaned dataset was visualized in Tableau through an interactive dashboard featuring:  
- **Property Count by Land Use** → Distribution of housing properties by land category  
- **Average Total Price by Land Use** → Real estate pricing patterns by land category  
- **Average Property Value by Bedrooms** → Relationship between bedrooms and property value  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** → ETL and data cleaning  
- **Tableau** → Dashboarding & visualization
